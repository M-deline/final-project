## Description
<a name="description"></a>
- This is a full stack MERN application focusing on anyone who travels a lot and wants to be able to choose a continent and view a list of cities that meet their criteria. The user is able to choose a continent and view cities, however, if they want to save a city they like, they must create an account. Then when they visit their saved cities page, they are able to view the cities or delete them as needed. This application uses the Nomad List Cities from Coinspot on RapidAPI.

## Challenges & Successes:
<a name="challenges--successes"></a>
- Our project was a success because we learned a lot about MERN apps and using GraphQL. The sign up and login forms work correctly and they connect to the database as well so that next time the user visits the site, they can log in to see their saved cities. 
- Another success was that...
- We struggled with figuring out how to correctly set up the 3rd paty API at first...

## Future Development:
<a name="future-development"></a>
- In the future, we would like to have a donation page fully set up that allows users to contribute to the site and it would have a card payment option. 
- We woould also like to implement more searching options and have the user be able to search by country, city, or continent.
- When the user saves a city or looks at a city, we would like to have a short description of the history or culture, population, and a picture of the city show up as well as the weather for user convenience.
